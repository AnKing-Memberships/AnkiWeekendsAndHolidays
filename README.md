# Move Reviews from Weekends and Holidays

Do you want to take a break from doing your Anki reviews without having them pile up on the weekends, holidays or a vacation? Or do you have specific days on the week when you're too busy to do the reviews? Then this add-on is the solution to your problem!

It works by re-scheduling the already scheduled cards anytime by moving them either before, or after the specified days. By default, the intervals never change by more than 10\%.

TODO insert before-after here!

## Usage and configuration

By default, the add-on will free up the weekends and nothing else. However, this behaviour can be changed to move the reviews away from specific dates and/or any day of the week.

Config can be edited in the Tools -> Add-on(Ctrl+Shift+A) -> Move Reviews from Weekends and Holidays. *Make sure to restart Anki after editing the configuration*.

Once you've set the dates and days of the week that you want to free up, you can use the shortcut *Ctrl+Shift+r* (by default) to reschedule the cards.
