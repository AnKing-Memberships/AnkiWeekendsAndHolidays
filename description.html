<b>Differences from the "Free weekend" addon</b>

This addon is heavily inspired by the <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/742185195" rel="nofollow">"Free weekend - or Any Other Day" addon </a>

However, the former only works with newly learned cards (cards already in review won't be affected), does not work with mobile apps, and might conflict with other add-ons that change the Scheduler behavior.

This add-on aims to solve these shortcomings by instead of patching the Scheduler, it reschedules already scheduled cards.

It can seamlessly be used together with the "Free weekend" add-on linked above, as well as other add-ons that affect the scheduler (for example, LoadBalancer).

<b>Addon description</b>

Do you want to take a break from doing your Anki reviews without having them pile up on the weekends, holidays or a vacation? Or do you have specific days on the week when you're too busy to do the reviews? Then this add-on is the solution to your problem!

It works by re-scheduling the already scheduled cards anytime by moving them either before, or after the specified days. By default, the intervals never change by more than 10%, or by 7 days in any case.

<b> Compatibility with mobile apps and other addons</b>

This add-on plays well with mobile versions of Anki (AnkiMobile/AnkiDroid), assuming that the user also uses the desktop version, as the cards scheduled on mobile will be moved away from the specified days when the rescheduling is run (with _Ctrl+Shift+r_), or at every startup if run at startup is chosen at configuration options.

The add-on does not directly modify the scheduler, but instead reschedules already schedules cards, so it should play well with addons that patch the scheduler (for example, load balancer), *but this is untested*.

<b> Usage and configuration </b>

By default, the add-on will free up the weekends and nothing else. However, this behaviour can be changed to move the reviews away from specific dates and/or any day of the week.

Config can be edited in the Tools -&gt; Add-on(Ctrl+Shift+A) -&gt; Move Reviews from Weekends and Holidays. *Make sure to restart Anki after editing the configuration*.

Once you've set the dates and days of the week that you want to free up, you can use the shortcut *Ctrl+Shift+r* (by default) to reschedule the cards.
